## InFact 
_*A digital agency specialising in charity and education | November 2017 - Present*_

### Devon Air Ambulace :helicopter:

### Overview :clipboard:
Some of the challenges facing DAA included: 
* Important documents getting **lost** in the post
* **Repetition of tasks** done by volunteers and the finance team
* Volunteers **wasting time** going to outlets where the collection boxes are still empty or getting calls from outlets when they aren't in the area
* The desire to improve the process but fear of knowing if the process would remain **accurate and safe**
* The struggle to adjust to a digitised **cashless world** when a chief source of income is cash donations
* Communicating **appreciation to the volunteers** who give up their time and effort , but are working remotely and spread out across the county


 __Our Solution?__ :bulb:
 
> A platform to help volunteers reduce the time spent on paperwork by filling in financial forms digitally and without repetition.

 **The aims of the solution**
* Reduce the time volunteers spend on completing forms
* Reduce errors 
* Reduce repetition of work done volunteers and finance department 
* Avoid the risk of any further lost documents 
* Increase the speed in which the finance team can review returns
* Simple and optimised towards the older demographic who make up the lions share of volunteers

Throughout our designs we took into consideration:
* The typical age of the user and the implication of that on design:
    * Large text and buttons
    * No distracting images or text
    * Narrow text width
    * Simply text
    * High colour contrast

### Blue Cross :dog:
 
### Overview :clipboard:
Blue Cross are facing many challenges in the pet market, mainly:
 - They are **overwhelmed by demand** for pets that they simply didn't have the capacity to fill
 - They are battling with **unregulated marketplaces** thriving on a **convenience-seeking public**
 - People struggling with complex emotions of **stigma** and **fear of judgement** brought on when giving up your pet
Currently people have to call Blue Cross to give up a pet which can become a lengthy process. So many opt to give up their pets on platforms such as Gumtree and Preloved which have lower barriers to entry and also provide financial incentive. 

__Our Solution?__ :bulb:

> A companion app for conscientious owners to find a loving new home for their pets

 **The aims of the solution**
* To give rehomers a **viable alternative** to marketplaces like Gumtree
* To reassure them through **positive language** that Blue Cross has the best interests of the animal at heart
* To assess the rehousing application in terms of need, and **triage** them appropriately
* To covertly **flag up** for signs of wrongdoing through questionnaires

### Unlock :unlock:

### Overview :clipboard:
Unlock have a real problem with their helpline which has seen an increase in calls relating to questions that can be answered through their online "information hub". They needed to find a way to reduce the number of calls related to simple questions to free up the time of the volunteers and focus on more challenging discussions.  
  
__Our Solution?__ :bulb:

Create a chat bot that users can click on and interactive with to answer their common questions, in particular related to travel to the U.S. 

This will enable users to easily discover whether they are elibgible to travel to the U.S. on an ESTA or a Visa. It also provides them with examples of conviction as well as alternative options on how to travel.

 **The aims of the solution**
* Allow the user to answer their own questions related to travel in the U.S :us:
* Reduce calls related to travel going through to the helpline :phone:

## All About Me
_*3 week Client Project | 25.9.17 - 13.10.17*_

### Summary :page_with_curl: 
At Founders and Coders we have a long standing relationship with [Anna Frued Centre](http://www.annafreud.org/) and the idea for "All About Me" came from a short ideation session with young people and clinicians. 
_*All About Me*_ is an app to help young people with mental ill health transition to adult care by providing them with a simple form that enables them to explain personal details about themselves to avoid repeating distressing memories with multiple clinicians. 

### Challenge :dizzy:
Currently young people use a paper form to provide information to their future clinicians. We needed to ensure that the app provides a more engaging alternative to the current solution whilst minimising the distress caused with more challenging questions.

### Solution :bulb:
Our aim is to make a user friendly and enjoyable app to enable young people to spend the time required to fill in the details to help them transition smoothly into adult care. 

### Prototype :pencil:
We took inspiration for this app from Typeform and Google Forms.
