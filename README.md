## All About Me
_*3 week Client Project | 25.9.17 - 13.10.17*_

### Summary :page_with_curl: 
At Founders and Coders we have a long standing relationship with [Anna Frued Centre](http://www.annafreud.org/) and the idea for "All About Me" came from a short ideation session with young people and clinicians. 
All about me is an app to help young people with mental ill health transition to adult care by providing them with a simple form that enables them to explain personal details about themselves to avoid repeating distressing memories with multiple new clinicians. 

### Challenge :dizzy:
Currently young people use a paper form to provide information the their future clinicians. We needed to ensure that the app provides a more engaging alternative to the current solution whilst minimising the distress caused with more challenging questions.

### Solution :bulb:
Our aim is to make a user friendly and enjoyable app to enable young people to spend the time required to fill in the details to help them transition smoothly into adult care. 

### Prototype :pencil:
We took inspiration for this app from Typeform and Google Forms. 

The total flow:

_*3 week project student project | 28.8.17 - 15.9.17*_
### Summary :page_with_curl: 
Lit Learn is a web-app to help UK school students prepare for their GCSE English and English Literature exams. Litlearn aims to help students anxious about the unseen text questions included in the [new English GCSE exams](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/07/18/students-find-new-english-gcse-torturous-may-deterred-continuing/) by giving them structured practice that builds in difficulty.

### Challenge :dizzy:
Giving students the opportunity to practice and receive feedback on questions in a subject that is marked subjectively. 
In English GCSE exams, there is the added challenge of giving students the confidence to tackle the 'unseen text' questions which now include 19th-Century texts that may have unfamiliar vocabulary and syntax.

### Solution :bulb:
We wanted to create a gamefied revision tool, where students could compare, rate and learn from others' answers. (In the design sprint so far, we created the mechanism for answering short questions. The answer mechanics are for a future sprint.)

To help students overcome anxiety about responding to long, unseen texts, we simplified the task by starting them off on a shorter piece of writing, and a multiple-choice question to help prompt ideas for their inferences.

### Design Sprint :art:
For our design spring we followed a number of methods to reach a 
* User research
* User Personas 
* Problem statements 
* "How might we?"
* "Crazy 8's"
* Prototyping
* User testing 

### Prototype :pencil2:
We spend a day building our prototype using Figma which we used to carry out our user testing and as a continual reference during development.  

We based our designs on the persona and took inspiration from Instagram and musical.ly.
