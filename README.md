### Summary :page_with_curl: 
Lit Learn is a web-app to help UK school students prepare for their GCSE English and English Literature exams. Litlearn aims to help students anxious about the unseen text questions included in the [new English GCSE exams](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/07/18/students-find-new-english-gcse-torturous-may-deterred-continuing/) by giving them structured practice that builds in difficulty.

### Challenge :dizzy:
Giving students the opportunity to practice and receive feedback on questions in a subject that is marked subjectively. 
In English GCSE exams, there is the added challenge of giving students the confidence to tackle the 'unseen text' questions which now include 19th-Century texts that may have unfamiliar vocabulary and syntax.

### Solution :bulb:
We wanted to create a gamefied revision tool, where students could compare, rate and learn from others' answers. (In the design sprint so far, we created the mechanism for answering short questions. The answer mechanics are for a future sprint.)

To help students overcome anxiety about responding to long, unseen texts, we simplified the task by starting them off on a shorter piece of writing, and a multiple-choice question to help prompt ideas for their inferences.

### Design Sprint :art:
For our design spring we followed a number of methods to reach a 
* User research
* User Personas 
* Problem statements 
* "How might we?"
* "Crazy 8's"
* Prototyping
* User testing 

### Prototype :pencil2:
We spend a day building our prototype using Figma which we used to carry out our user testing and as a continual reference during development.
