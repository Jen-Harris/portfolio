## Donut4Life 
_*1 Day Hackathon in collaboration with RNLI, Facebook & Ladies that UX | 4.11.17*_  

### Summary :page_with_curl: 
The Royal National Life Boat Institution (RNLI) is the largest charity that saves lives at sea in the UK. As a team we focused on exploring ways to _*"Encourage walkers to behave safetly near the water"*_. 

### Challenge :dizzy:
Currently in the UK there are 400 preventable water fatalities a year, with over 360,000 globally. 
In the UK walking is alarmingly the 2nd highest cause of fatalities in the UK. These are people who are typically familiar with their walking route and have an 80% likelihood to be male.
The RNLI feel strongly that these would be preventable with the correct education amongst the vulnerable and want to use technology to help.   
  
### Solution :bulb:
As a team we came up with a joint hardware and software solution.    
#### Hardware  
We invisioned the hardware device to have the appearance of a life buoy and be used a key ring or necklace. The device when squeezed would have the ability to alert your local RNLI representative if you are in a dangerous situation.

#### Software  
The companion software would compliment the hardware by providing users somewhere to:  
* Regiter their keyring
* Invite friends to start using the technology
* Educate users through trivia and _*"Did you know?"*_ features
* Raise awareness about the tide by having alerts and and clear high-tide times built into the dashboard  

For our design we took inspiration from the RNLI colour scheme and design elments from Fitbit. we created the following prototype using Sketch and Marvel:

## All About Me
_*3 week Client Project | 25.9.17 - 13.10.17*_

### Summary :page_with_curl: 
At Founders and Coders we have a long standing relationship with [Anna Frued Centre](http://www.annafreud.org/) and the idea for "All About Me" came from a short ideation session with young people and clinicians. 
_*All About Me*_ is an app to help young people with mental ill health transition to adult care by providing them with a simple form that enables them to explain personal details about themselves to avoid repeating distressing memories with multiple clinicians. 

### Challenge :dizzy:
Currently young people use a paper form to provide information the their future clinicians. We needed to ensure that the app provides a more engaging alternative to the current solution whilst minimising the distress caused with more challenging questions.

### Solution :bulb:
Our aim is to make a user friendly and enjoyable app to enable young people to spend the time required to fill in the details to help them transition smoothly into adult care. 

### Prototype :pencil:
We took inspiration for this app from Typeform and Google Forms.

### Final Product :sparkles:
The app is hosted on Heroku and you can see it [here](https://allaboutme-annafreud.herokuapp.com/) :eyes: 

Or look at this short video that shows basic functionality of the app:

## LitLearn :books::iphone:
_*3 week project student project | 28.8.17 - 15.9.17*_
### Summary :page_with_curl: 
Lit Learn is a web-app to help UK school students prepare for their GCSE English and English Literature exams. Litlearn aims to help students anxious about the unseen text questions included in the [new English GCSE exams](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/07/18/students-find-new-english-gcse-torturous-may-deterred-continuing/) by giving them structured practice that builds in difficulty.

### Challenge :dizzy:
Giving students the opportunity to practice and receive feedback on questions in a subject that is marked subjectively. 
In English GCSE exams, there is the added challenge of giving students the confidence to tackle the 'unseen text' questions which now include 19th-Century texts that may have unfamiliar vocabulary and syntax.

### Solution :bulb:
We wanted to create a gamefied revision tool, where students could compare, rate and learn from others' answers. (In the design sprint so far, we created the mechanism for answering short questions. The answer mechanics are for a future sprint.)

To help students overcome anxiety about responding to long, unseen texts, we simplified the task by starting them off on a shorter piece of writing, and a multiple-choice question to help prompt ideas for their inferences.

### Design Sprint :art:
For our design spring we followed a number of methods:
* User research
* User Personas 
* Problem statements 
* "How might we?"
* "Crazy 8's"
* Prototyping
* User testing 

### Prototype :pencil2:
We spent a day building our prototype using Figma. We used this prototype to carry out our user testing and as a continual reference during development.
